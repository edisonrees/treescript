TreeScript, whilst being quite plentiful of commands, does not follow a syntax like Java or Python. It is however primarily used by the User, not the Computer. You make up your own syntax, and then you can put it into 
Java or Python, or any language. It is used to plan, not code.

Treescript is very baby-beta, and has many issues. Please submit requests in the Issues folder.
